__Lessons Learned:__

Day 1 - harder than i was expecting for the first day. Made me think a lot. discovered .rindex() and .rfind(). Putting it down and coming back to the code is really helpful for me. Also, don't be afraid to just rewrite part 2 if needed.

Day 2 - feels good when it works first try :) (after debugging lol)

Day 3 - I CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM :( my answer 532401 is too low
