__Lessons Learned:__

Day 1 - harder than i was expecting for the first day. Made me think a lot. discovered .rindex() and .rfind() (also can adjust the start). Putting it down and coming back to the code is really helpful for me. Also, don't be afraid to just rewrite part 2 if needed.

Day 2 - feels good when it works first try :) (after debugging lol)

Day 3 - I CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM :( my answer 532401 is too low 

Day 4 - counting copies this was fun

Day 5 - first attempt ran for so long i had to kill it bc i forgot a break statement. also remember to fix obj types first otherwise crap in, crap out. part 2 is like part one but another level deeper...
