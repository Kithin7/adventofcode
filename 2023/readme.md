__Lessons Learned:__

** = 2 stars
*_ = 1 star
__ = 0 stars

**Day 1 - harder than i was expecting for the first day. Made me think a lot. discovered .rindex() and .rfind() (also can adjust the start). Putting it down and coming back to the code is really helpful for me. Also, don't be afraid to just rewrite part 2 if needed.

**Day 2 - feels good when it works first try :) (after debugging lol)

__Day 3 - I CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM :( my answer 532401 is too low 

**Day 4 - counting copies this was fun

*_Day 5 - first attempt ran for so long i had to kill it bc i forgot a break statement. also remember to fix obj types first otherwise crap in, crap out. part 2 is like part one but another level deeper...

**Day 6 - solving parabolas ezpz

__Day 7 - wip... probably should change how i am storing and looking at the cards/hands...

**Day 8 - part 1 ezpz first try, part 2 was going to take my code like 23 days to run. Had to look up a hint and it just made it easy... felt like a spoiler bc all the hard thinking was over after knowing the hint... idk how to feel about getting hints like that. would have preferred the hint to say "look at each starting point and where it goes" or something like that. The question prompting me to solve simulataneously was definately a distraction.
